.SH NAME
stopspam \- script to ban spam ip's on the fly

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B stopspam
[OPTION]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Anti-spam system that helps minimize the amount of spammers that
connect to your server by banning their ip's using one of the ip text
databases provided by http://www.stopforumspam.com/downloads. The
script also keeps this database updated by periodically downloading
latest version from the stopforumspam website or any other url that
you set on the configuration file.
.PP
To keep the iptable rules clean the script bans every ip that is found
to be used for spamming for a period of 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes
are due the ip is unbanned in order to minimize the amount of rules
actively used on iptables.
